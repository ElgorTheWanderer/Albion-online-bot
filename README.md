# Albion-online-bot

# Work is still in progress.

This is Discord bot for Albion Online.

This bot is an alternative for other paid services.

This bot is intended to be free to use.

Bot will soon be deployed on VPS and available to public.

!price command accepts EN/RUS exect in-game names of items and returns table of best sell and best buy prices in each city for each possible item tier of normal quality.
It uses https://www.albion-online-data.com/ API, that's why results are no as accurate as one would like it to be.
Anyway it gives general understanding of prices distribution between cities.
